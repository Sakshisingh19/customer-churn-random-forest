# Customer Churn Prediction Using Random Forest

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, engineer meaningful features, and build a classification model that identifies customers who are at high risk of churning, enabling data-driven retention strategies.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based and utility-driven businesses. Understanding the factors that influence churn allows organizations to take proactive steps to retain customers and reduce revenue loss.

This project explores the role of **price sensitivity and customer behavior** in churn prediction.
